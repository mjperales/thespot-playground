# TheSpot Playground

Playground for LeetCode problems. Anything that can just run on node. No React or frontend. Check out my `fullstack-playground` to use React and Express together.

## Get Started

Add your function in `/helpers` and import it to `index.ts`. Use `npm run play` to run your code.

# Tests

You can also create a Jest test to easily run tests while you solve the problem. Use `npm run test` or `npm run test:watch`

## Fixtures

You can find a fixture of the GET call in `./fixtures/hubspot-call-logs.json` and then my attempt answer will be `./fixtures/hubspot-results.json`.
